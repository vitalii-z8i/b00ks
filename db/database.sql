1	The Raider:A Highland Guard Novel	The year of our lord thirteen hundred and twelve. Since Robert the Bruce first made his bid for the crown six years ago, he has defeated not only the English but also the powerful Scottish noblemen who stood against him. After a much-needed reprieve from warfare for Bruce and his men, in late summer 1310 the English marched north to invade Scotland, this time under the leadership of Edward II.  But the second Edward is nothing like his “Hammer of the Scots” father, and the English campaign was a disaster. Bruce refused to take the field in pitched battle. Instead, with the help of the elite warriors of the legendary Highland Guard, Bruce waged a “secret war,” using the pirate tactics he had perfected, harrying the English with surprise attacks and skirmishes, and wreaking havoc on the soldiers’ morale.

4	1	1	Prologue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGud Robert Boyd, that worthi was and wicht\r\n\r\n(Good Robert Boyd that worthy wise and strong)\r\n\r\n—Blind Harry, The Wallace\r\n\r\nKildrummy Castle, Scottish Highlands, October 1306\r\n\r\nKilled? Rosalin nearly choked on a bit of beef.\r\n\r\n“Are you all right?” her brother asked, leaning over to pat her on the back.\r\n\r\nAfter a burst of coughing, she took a sip of sweetened wine and nodded. “I’m fine.” Seeing his concern, she managed a smile. “Really. I’m sorry for the disturbance. You were saying something about the prisoners?”\r\n\r\nHer attempt at nonchalance didn’t fool him. He frowned. He’d been speaking in a low voice to her guardian, Sir Humphrey, on his other side, and the conversation obviously hadn’t been meant for her ears. She blinked up at him innocently, but Robert, the first Baron de Clifford, hadn’t become one of the most important commanders in the war against the rebel Scots because of his rank and handsome face—although he certainly possessed both. Nay, he’d risen so high in King Edward’s estimation because he was smart, loyal, and determined. He was also one of the greatest knights in England, and she was fiercely proud of him.\r\n\r\nEven if he was entirely too perceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“An unfortunate accident, that is all. Part of the wall collapsed when the prisoners were dismantling it. Two of the rebels were crushed by the stone and killed.”\r\n\r\nHer heart jumped to her throat and a small cry of distress escaped before she could help it. Oh God, please don’t let it be him!\r\n\r\nAware of her brother’s watchful gaze, she attempted to cover her too concerned reaction with a maidenly, “That’s horrible!”\r\n\r\nHe studied her a little longer, and then patted her hand. “Do not let it distress you.”\r\n\r\nBut she was distressed. Deeply distressed. Although she certainly couldn’t tell her brother why. If he learned about her fascination with one of the rebel prisoners, he would send her back to London on the first ship, as he’d threatened to do when she’d arrived unexpectedly a week ago with her new guardian, Sir Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford.\r\n\r\n“Christ’s Cross, Rosalin! This is the last place in Christendom suitable for a young girl.”\r\n\r\nBut the opportunity to see Cliff had been too tempting to resist. With her in London and her brother fighting the Scottish rebels in the North, it had been nearly two years since she’d seen him, and she missed him desperately. He, Maud (Cliff’s wife of eight years), and the children were all the family she had left, and if she had to venture into Hades to see them, she would. Maud would have made the journey with Rosalin and the earl’s party, but she’d just discovered she was with child again.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand why the wall is being dismantled in the first place,” Rosalin said. “I thought we won the war?”\r\n\r\nHer distraction worked. Cliff loved nothing more than to talk about England’s great victory. Robert Bruce’s bid for the crown had failed. The outlaw king had been forced to flee Scotland, and the English were now occupying most of Scotland’s important castles, including this one, the former stronghold of the Scottish Earls of Mar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“We did. Robert Bruce’s short-lived rebellion is at an end. He might have escaped the noose set for him at Dunaverty Castle, but he won’t find refuge in the Western Isles for long. Our fleet will find him.” He shrugged. “Even if they don’t, he only has a handful of men left under his command.”\r\n\r\nShe lowered her voice to a whisper. “But aren’t they Highlanders?”\r\n\r\nHer brother laughed and tweaked her nose. Though sixteen—nearly seventeen—was much too old for tweaking, she didn’t mind. She knew just how fortunate she was to have a brother who cared for her so deeply. Not many fourteen-year-old boys would have bothered themselves with a four-year-old sister on the death of their parents, but Cliff had always watched out for her. Even when they were both made wards of the king, he always made sure she knew she was not alone. If he sometimes acted like more of an overprotective father than a brother, she didn’t mind. To her, he was both.\r\n\r\n“They aren’t bogeymen, little one. Or supermen, no matter what you might hear at court. They might fight like barbarians, but when they meet the steel of an English knight’s sword, their blood runs as red as any other.”\r\n\r\nAs she wasn’t supposed to be watching the prisoners, she refrained from asking why they were kept so heavily guarded then.\r\n\r\nHer brother turned back to Sir Humphrey, and Rosalin bided her time, waiting for the long midday meal to come to an end before racing up to her chamber in the Snow Tower.\r\n\r\nUsually she delayed her return to her chamber as long as possible. Cliff had permitted her to stay in Scotland at Kildrummy only under the condition that she keep to her room except for during meals and chapel (he didn’t want there to be any chance of her coming into contact with one of them), and the small chamber had begun to feel like a prison. (When she protested that it wasn’t fair, the other ladies in Sir Humphrey’s party weren’t being confined, he replied that the other ladies were not his sixteen-year-old sister!) But right now all she could think about was the window that looked over the courtyard and shield-shaped curtain wall. The same curtain wall that had collapsed and killed the two prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer heart raced as fast as her feet as she climbed the seven—seven!—flights of stairs to the top level of the luxurious tower. The Scots might be “rebellious barbarians,” but they certainly knew how to build castles, which was one of the reasons King Edward was so anxious to have Kildrummy destroyed. The “Hammer of the Scots,” as King Edward was known, was making sure no other rebels could use the formidable stronghold as a refuge in the future.	2014-07-17 13:41:31.157537	2014-07-17 13:41:31.157537
6	3	1	A shout from the courtyard below made her stop what she’d been about to say.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what that is all about,” Lenore said.\r\n\r\nBut Rosalin had already jumped from the chair and raced to the window. Her heart stopped, a strangled cry escaping from between her lips before she could smother it with her hand. The red-haired rebel was kneeling in the dirt, holding his side where one of the soldiers must have struck him. The cloth and pieces of beef and bread that she’d smuggled out to them last night were strewn on the ground in front of him. The soldier was shouting at him, using his fists and the back of his hand to punctuate his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t hard to guess what he was asking.\r\n\r\nThe red-haired man shook his head and the soldier hit him again—this time with so much force his head snapped back and blood sprayed around him like a bubble that had popped.\r\n\r\nHe crumpled to the ground.\r\n\r\nShe cried out in horror, and Lenore tried to pull her away. “Come away, m’lady. Those vile beasts are not fit for your eyes. Brigands and barbarians, that’s what they are. I hope your brother draws and quarters every one of them!”\r\n\r\nRosalin barely heard her words. She shook her off, crying out again as she sensed—she knew—what the Scot would do. He roared forward, tossing off the two soldiers who’d been holding him as if they were poppets. His fist slammed into the jaw of the soldier who’d beaten his friend. The soldier had barely hit the ground when the Scot was over him, driving his powerful fist into him again and again like a battering ram until the soldier lay motionless on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt seemed there was a stunned pause before the courtyard erupted in chaos.\r\n\r\nLenore gasped in horror from behind her. “The prisoners are attacking!”\r\n\r\n“No. Oh God, no,” Rosalin groaned softly as the melee ensued. What have I done?\r\n\r\nThe Scot fought like a man possessed, like one of those berserkers of Norse legend. Using nothing but his hands, he fended off half a dozen of her brother’s men. Each time one of them tried to get hold of him, he made some kind of quick maneuver and twisted out of the man’s grasp. Usually the soldiers ended up on their backs. The blond-haired prisoner had managed to grab one of the hammers used to take down the wall and had taken a position at the Scot’s flank. Together they were a two-man army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne by one the other prisoners were subdued, but the two men seemed as if they could hold off capture forever.\r\n\r\nBut of course they couldn’t. Without armor and proper weaponry, all it took was one well-placed pike in the side of the blond-haired warrior, and one powerful hit of the hammer on the ribs of the Scot, and the English had regained the upper hand.\r\n\r\nHer heart was pounding. Tears were streaming from her eyes as her brother’s soldiers surrounded the two men.\r\n\r\nGod in heaven, they are going to kill them!\r\n\r\nWithout thinking of what she was doing, only knowing she had to put a stop to the fighting, she raced down the stairs, heedless of Lenore’s worried cries behind her. She reached the yard only moments after her brother and his men, two of whom prevented her from going farther than a few feet beyond the tower door. “You shouldn’t be here, my lady,” one of the men said. “Go back to the tower. This will all be over soon.”\r\n\r\nThat was exactly what she feared.\r\n\r\n“I need to see my brother.” She tried to look around one of the men, but with the crowd of people who’d flooded the courtyard she couldn’t see anything.\r\n\r\nShe heard her brother’s voice from up ahead. “What is the meaning of this?”\r\n\r\nA series of English voices responded with “stealing food,” “find out,” and “Scots attacked.”\r\n\r\n“Your man was beating a man to death for something he could not answer. He would have killed him had I not stopped him.”\r\n\r\nThe sound of the deep, powerful voice reverberated through her like a clap of thunder, jolting in its intensity. It was her Scot; she knew it.\r\n\r\nHer brother said something she couldn’t hear and a few more English voices went back and forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen her brother spoke again. “Take him to the pit, where he won’t incite a damned riot.”\r\n\r\n“Is this your English justice, Clifford?” that deep voice sneered. “Killing a man for defending someone who could not fight back? I could have taken a dozen of your men with me—next time I will.”\r\n\r\nRosalin tried to push through again, but one of the men—a knight who she thought was named Thomas—forcibly held her back. “Your brother won’t like you being here, my lady. You need to get back to the tower.”\r\n\r\n“But what will happen to them?”\r\n\r\nHe gave her a quizzical look. “Why, they’ll be executed, of course.”\r\n\r\nThe blood drained from her face. She must have looked like she was going to faint, because he called another one of the soldiers over and together they steered her back into the tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosalin waited for what seemed like hours for her brother to return to his solar. Her hands twisted anxiously in her lap. The glass of wine that she’d drunk for courage tossed in her stomach.\r\n\r\nShe dreaded the conversation ahead of her but knew it could not be avoided. She couldn’t let those men be killed because of what she’ done.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when her brother finally entered the room. He looked surprised to see her. “What are you doing here, Rosie-lin? I thought you’d be readying for the evening meal.” He frowned, seeing the distress on her face. “Is something wrong?”\r\n\r\nShe blinked up at him, feeling the heat gather in her throat and behind her eyes. “It’s all my fault!” Unable to hold back, the tears and emotion came pouring out. “I gave them the food. I didn’t think there would be any harm and they looked so hungry. I was only trying to help.” She latched on to his arm, tears streaming down her cheeks. “You can’t punish them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jumbled confession took him a moment to sort through, but when he did, his face darkened. It wasn’t often that her brother was angry with her, and she hated it. “Damn it, Rosalin, I told you to stay away from them! Do you have any idea how dangerous those men are?”\r\n\r\n“I do. I swear I didn’t go anywhere near them.” She explained how she took the scraps of food to the cart at night. He seemed to relax a little, and his expression wasn’t quite as thunderous. “I only wanted to ease their suffering. I didn’t mean for this to happen.”\r\n\r\nHe gave her a long, steady look. “You never meant for things like this to happen, which is exactly why you don’t belong here. Your heart is too soft for war. These men are not one of your scullery maids with blistered hands or a serving wench who needs to spend more time with her sick baby rather than tend her duties.”\r\n\r\n“But Katie’s hands were so chapped they were bleeding, and it wasn’t fair that Meggie lost a week’s pay because she missed a few hours—”\r\n\r\nHer brother held up his hand, stopping her. “That’s what I’m trying to say. These men are hardened killers—they are not deserving of your kindness.”\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head, unable to meet his gaze. “I had to do something.”\r\n\r\nShe heard him sigh and a moment later, he wrapped his arm around her and drew her to his side. Relief that he’d forgiven her only made her sob harder. “I’m so sorry.”\r\n\r\nHe murmured soothing words and rocked her against him until she quieted. It reminded her of the night her father had died, and the night less than a year later when their mother had followed. “You can’t stay here, little one. I should have sent you home right away, but I was selfish. I missed you, and seeing your face was like a breath of spring air in this cesspit.”	2014-07-17 13:53:28.778727	2014-07-17 13:53:28.778727
7	4	1	She looked up at him, eyes burning. “You are sending me away?”\r\n\r\nPlease, not that. Anything but that.\r\n\r\nHe nodded solemnly. “Aye, but only for a while. I will come see you in London as soon as I am done here. The king will wish a report, and I can give it to him personally. I will bring Maud and the children. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” She nodded; he knew she would. He smiled teasingly. “Besides, I want to see all these suitors Hereford has been telling me about.”\r\n\r\nHeat crawled up her cheeks. That was one of the reasons she’d come. The attention at court had become impossible and none of the men interested her. No man had interested her until…\r\n\r\n“Does that mean you will spare them?”\r\n\r\nIt took him a moment to follow her leap in conversation. His mouth tightened—whether from anger or the unpleasantness of the topic, she didn’t know.\r\n\r\n“Your misguided charity changes nothing.”\r\n\r\n“But it isn’t fair—”\r\n\r\nHe cut her off in a voice that brokered no argument. “This is war, Rosalin. Fair doesn’t enter into it. They nearly killed three of my men. Whatever the provocation, prisoners cannot be allowed to fight back. Ever. Especially these prisoners. They are not worth your tears.”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\nHe cut her off again, his face getting that implacable, we’re-done-talking-about-it look. “I will hear no more on the subject. These men have been given only a temporary reprieve from the executioner’s axe. But they have proved too dangerous even for that. They are brigands who fight without chivalry and honor. Their leader is a vicious scourge who would slit your pretty neck without thinking twice. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\nHer eyes widened. Her brother spoke with such conviction, but his words did not jibe with the man she’d watched the past couple weeks. Knowing that Cliff would not be gainsaid, all she could do was nod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe smiled. “Good, then we will hear no more of this. What’s this I hear about your taking after our illustrious ancestor?”\r\n\r\nRosalin blushed at the gentle teasing about her embarrassing nickname. Their infamous great-great-great-aunt Rosamund Clifford had captured the heart of King Henry II and had gone down in history as “The Fair Rosamund.” Apparently, the men at court had taken to calling her “The Fair Rosalin.”\r\n\r\nShe tried to play along with her brother’s teasing, but she could not forget the horrible fate awaiting the men in the prison, especially the one languishing in the pit prison, who’d been forced to defend his friend because of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the evening meal and the long hours of the night it stayed with her. She could think of nothing else.\r\n\r\nIt was wrong. The word echoed over and over in her head no matter what she tried to do. Eventually the voice grew too loud to ignore. Sometime in the small hours of the night, she rose from bed, donned a pair of slippers and a dark hooded cloak, and slipped out of her chamber. She didn’t know whether she could do anything, but she knew she had to try.\r\n\r\nThis was partially her fault, and rightly or wrongly, if she didn’t do something, she would feel responsible for the deaths of those men for the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nBut it was one man’s death that would haunt her. The man she’d watched for over two weeks, the man who’d sacrificed himself, who had selflessly given his food and shouldered more of the burden for his friend, did not deserve to die. She knew it deep in her soul with a certainty that could not be ignored. War or not, it was wrong, and she had to try to make it right, even if…even if it meant letting him go free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the treacherous thought was out, it felt as if an enormous weight had been lifted from her shoulders. She knew what she had to do—or try to do, if it were possible.\r\n\r\nExiting the Snow Tower, she paused in the shadows to get her bearings. She didn’t have a plan. All she knew was that the Scot had been moved to the pit prison, which was located below the old keep next to the burned-down Great Hall. She’d walked past it every night on making her deliveries—quickly, as the forbidding old stone building hadn’t been used in some time and seemed very dark. But there was a torch there now, burning from its iron perch beside the doorway. Drawing a little closer, she kept tight to the shadows of the wall and watched.\r\n\r\nDear God, what was she doing? She couldn’t help but feel the impossibility of her plight. How was a sixteen-year-old girl going to break anyone out of a pit prison without help? Without a plan? She couldn’t very well just walk in there, open the door, and pull him out.\r\n\r\nCould she?\r\n\r\nWhat about the guards? Even though she couldn’t see anyone right now, and the pit prison offered little chance of escape, there had to be at least one.\r\n\r\nThere was. A soldier appeared from the direction of the warden’s tower, where the prisoners were being held, walked back and forth a few times in front of the entry to the old keep, and then disappeared. About five minutes later he did it again. After two more times, she had to hope it was a pattern. The next time he left, she waited until he was around the corner and then darted into the entrance of the keep.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch black and cold. Very cold. Chill-run-down-your-spine cold.\r\n\r\nThere are no such thing as ghosts…no such thing as ghosts.\r\n\r\nBut if the dead were ever inclined to walk the earth, this would be the perfect place to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter giving her eyes a few moments to adjust to the darkness, she moved around the room, looking for the entrance to the pit prison, finding it in a small stone antechamber off the main entry. The room was no more than three or four feet wide, with a small wooden door covering one corner of the stone floor. She heaved a sigh of relief, seeing that the door had a simple latch rather than a lock.\r\n\r\nHow many minutes had gone by? Two, maybe three? Very carefully she slid the iron latch, her heart stopping more than a few beats when it squeaked—loudly. She froze, but when no one came rushing in with a sword drawn, she slid the latch fully out of the way and grabbed the edge of the wooden door to lift.\r\n\r\nIt was heavier than it appeared, and she struggled, but finally managed to open it. A rush of cold, dank air pushed her back for a moment, but eventually she kneeled over the hole and peered down into the darkness. It was dead silent. At first she didn’t see anything, but then she saw the unmistakable glow of white gazing up at her.\r\n\r\nShe startled.\r\n\r\n“Morning already?” he sneered. “I was just getting comfortable.”\r\n\r\nGod, that voice! Deep and powerful, it seemed to reverberate through her bones. “Shhh,” she whispered. “The guard will be coming back.”\r\n\r\nThough she knew it was impossible, she swore she could see him stiffen with surprise.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Shhh,” she pleaded again. “Please. The guard will hear you.”\r\n\r\nLeaving the door open, she raced out of the small antechamber and plastered her back to the wall next to the entry. Holding her breath for what seemed like eternity, she waited for the guard to approach. With each footstep her heart stopped, starting only when she heard the fall of the next. When the footsteps finally moved away, she ran back to the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“We have to hurry,” she whispered. “He’ll be back in a few minutes.”\r\n\r\nThe Scot didn’t waste time questioning her, taking charge in the coolly efficient manner of a man accustomed to the role. “They lowered me down with a rope tied to a latch in the wall. See if it’s still there.”	2014-07-17 13:55:39.847547	2014-07-17 13:55:39.847547
8	1	5	England. Portsmouth Dockyard, 25th March, 1559\r\n\r\nAnne resisted the temptation to turn and flutter one last wave at her mother. The Countess of Southampton had said goodbye on the pier and would not wish her daughter to exhibit additional emotion. Wearing a blue velvet gown, her hair coiled under a caul net and veil, Anne played the part of baroness with no outward sign of the storm roiling beneath her skin.\r\n\r\nClutching Anne’s arm, Hanna walked up the gangway beside her. “I still cannot believe he wouldn’t allow me to escort you all the way to northern England. Heaven’s stars, you’ll be alone.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be fine.” Anne gave her serving maid a squeeze. “But I shall miss you most of all.”\r\n\r\n“If you need me when you reach Alnwick, ask the baron to send a missive and I’ll come straight away.”\r\n\r\nA vise clamped around Anne’s heart. “I know you will.”\r\n\r\nThey neared the galleon and a sailor reached for Anne’s hand.\r\n\r\nHanna released her grasp and gestured forward. “Milady.”\r\n\r\nAnne stepped aboard the Flying Swan—the ship that would ferry her away from everything familiar. Hanna wrapped her in a warm embrace. “A baron who won’t pay for a single serving maid to accompany his new bride doesn’t deserve her—at least not a lady as gracious as you.”\r\n\r\nAnne closed her eyes and squeezed them, trying not to tremble. “Everything will be fine. I shall write often and plead with the Lord Wharton to send for you.” She pulled back and held Hanna at arm’s length. “You shall see. His lordship will be generous. He merely doesn’t know me yet—doesn’t know our history.”\r\n\r\nAnne watched her maid, her dearest friend return to Mother’s carriage. Alone she stood, abandoned on the deck of the galleon. Five days it would take to sail to the mouth of the River Aln where she would meet her husband for the first time. Five days without a serving maid? Anne still did not understand the baron’s reasoning.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at her gloves, covering the bare ring finger and shuddered. He’s how much older?\r\n\r\nAnne could see only the top of the carriage as it wound through the busy dockyard, and she reached her hand out as if she could touch it one last time. But the countess’s carriage turned and disappeared behind the stone wall of the Fox and Hounds Inn.\r\n\r\nAnne gripped the rail and craned her neck, but Mother was gone—Hanna gone—Anne’s life winding away, like the wheels that rolled back to Titchfield House without her. Her heart gripped her chest like a musket had blown a gaping hole through it. There she stood, like a pawn to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nAnne’s eyes drifted to the boisterous scene on the pier. Men loaded barrels onto carts pulled by big draft horses and merchants argued. She searched for a familiar face, and the hole in her heart enlarged when she recognized not a single person. She squared her shoulders. I’d best become accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nBehind her, the quartermaster shouted the command to cast off. She leaned over the rail to watch the ship ease away from the pier with the water’s swirling torrent. To jump now would be certain death, having never learned to swim. For a second, she contemplated it. Death could be better than sharing a bed with a husband older than her own deceased father.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fortescue moved in beside her. “May I show you to your quarters, Lady Anne?” He smiled, wearing a feathered cap and neat black beard, fashionably groomed to a point and highlighted by the white ruff of his collar. His dark eyes reflected a glint of humor—he smirked. How comical it must be to escort a lady to a husband whom she had never met.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You will be under my protection until we meet the baron. If you should want for anything, please ask.”\r\n\r\n“That is very kind of you,” she said, though the humor in his eyes was not kind in the least.\r\n\r\n“’Tis nothing. You are a guest aboard the Flying Swan and with good wind, we should reach your new husband in no time. She’s a grand ship, none faster.”\r\n\r\nThe deck swarmed with able-bodied sailors, swinging from the rigging as the wind slapped and ballooned the giant sails.\r\n\r\nWhile the quartermaster bellowed orders, Captain Fortescue led her aft to a narrow corridor. He used a key to open her cabin door and stepped aside. “I must apologize. I’m sure there is not as much space as a lady of your stature would be accustomed.”\r\n\r\nThe tiny room held a small bed, leaving room enough for a narrow aisle between the cot and her luggage, which lined the far wall. A wooden chair, a round table, a bowl and ewer with a looking glass bolted above it—crude accommodations by anyone’s imagination. “This will be fine.” Anne squeezed past the captain, bumping her hip on one of her trunks.\r\n\r\n“Very well.” He reached for the latch. “My officers and I would be honored if you would dine with us.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like that. Thank you.” Perhaps they’ll serve a draught of hemlock.\r\n\r\n“I shall knock on your door when it is time.” He moved to pull it closed, but stopped. “’Tis best to keep the door locked when you are within.”\r\n\r\nAnne turned the lock and then covered her face with her hands. Only now did she allow the tears to come.\r\n\r\nLord Wharton, first Baron of Wharton, had seen her once at Queen Elizabeth’s coronation five months ago. A hundred times, Anne had filed through her memory of that visit to court. She and her sisters had met so many people, so many grand men had kissed her hand and introduced themselves, but she could not place the baron—a grey haired man, no doubt—if he had hair. Anne staggered to the bed, buried her face in the pillow and surrendered to her silent sobs.\r\n\r\nSince the day her uncle had come to Titchfield House and revealed she had been wed, Anne needed smelling salts to keep her wits. She hadn’t taken to her bed with a bout of melancholy because her marriage had been performed by proxy. The age of the man mortified her. At eight and fifty, Lord Wharton was a widower with four children who were all older than Anne—past her prime at nine and ten.\r\n\r\nShe sat up with a jolt and slammed her fist into the pillow. She would have to meet those children. Would she ever be able to look them in the eye when they referred to her as stepmother? The pillow dropped to the floor. Surely there are grandchildren as well.\r\n\r\nAnne pressed her knuckles against her temples and fought to regain control. She would overcome this. She would prove herself worthy to the baron’s estate just as she had done at Titchfield House. His lordship might be old, but he’d discover he had married far more than a pretty courtier. Anne steadied her breath and repeated her title, “Baroness of Wharton.” Married to a stranger nine and thirty years her senior.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nCalum MacLeod stood on the deck of the Sea Dragon and peered through the spyglass. Just as his informants had advised, the new English racing galleon had set sail. The ship was bound for the north, laden with grain and cloth—all things his people on Raasay desperately needed. Things his miserly brother, living off the fat on the Isle of Lewis, refused to part with.\r\n\r\nCalum intended to seize it for them. His father had gone to great lengths to separate the clan and secure a charter to name him laird over the Hebride isle. Yes, it was insignificant compared to Lewis, but his clansmen were fighters. The people of Raasay fought through the eight months of winter, raising their bairns as they ploughed the rocky soil, more often frozen than not. Calum aimed to remedy their plight by building their wealth or dying in the process. On one thing he was firm, he would not recline in his keep while his people starved.\r\n\r\nHe salivated, admiring the galleon’s sleek lines. With three masts and a trim hull, she could outrun any ship in Her Majesty’s fleet, including Calum’s own carrack, his beloved Sea Dragon.\r\n\r\n“She’s a beauty.” John Urquhart, cousin on his mother’s side, quartermaster, and Calum’s closest friend stood beside him.\r\n\r\n“Aye, and her cargo will keep us fed until the harvest.”\r\n\r\nJohn didn’t have quite as much height as Calum, but they shared the family’s tendency toward auburn hair and blue eyes. “I’m thinking more of the riches we’ll gain once she’s ours.”\r\n\r\nCalum lowered the spyglass and grinned. “Our people will prosper and then we can kick our heels up and enjoy the spoils.”\r\n\r\n“Do ye think ye can ever walk away? The sea’s yer mistress.”\r\n\r\n“True.” Calum watched the sun kiss the western horizon. “We’ll not have time to think on it until the keep is finished and our clan is strong.”\r\n\r\n“I still dunna understand it.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Why yer father commissioned ye Chief of Raasay, but kept all the riches in Lewis.”\r\n\r\n“’Twas not me place to question Da’s decision—only to honor it.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, but he just kicked ye out to make a go with the poor souls on the island.”\r\n\r\n“He gave me his trust.” Calum ran his hand along the worn rail of his ship. “Besides, I received a fair bit more than a second son could hope for.”\r\n\r\n“If we dunna starve, ’twill be a blessing.”\r\n\r\n“If we plunder that ship, we’ll no’ starve.”	2014-07-17 13:57:43.346953	2014-07-17 13:57:43.346953
9	2	5	The tap on her door roused Anne from sleep. “Supper, my lady.”\r\n\r\nThe thought of food brought on a heave. She gulped back burning bile and tottered across the floor. Cracking open the door, she tried to focus on the captain, but his smile rose and fell with the rolling waves. Swallowing, she leaned heavily on the latch. “I am afraid I have not yet found my sea legs. Will you consider it discourteous if I excuse myself?”\r\n\r\n“Your color is a bit pale. It can take a few days for a land maiden to gain her legs.” He bowed. “I shall have my cabin boy bring you a tray.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nAnne lay back on her bed and stared at the wooden rafters. The swells of the ocean had increased since she’d cried herself to sleep. She hugged her pillow and closed her eyes, trying to will away the sickness.\r\n\r\nAnne sat up when the boy unlocked her door and pushed inside. He set a silver tray on the table and lit the lamp on her wall. “Ye might want to eat quick, milady. The sea’s angry tonight and your meal’s likely to skip over the table lips and fall to the floor.”\r\n\r\n“My thanks.” Anne eyed the latch. “Pardon me, but does everyone have a key to my stateroom?”\r\n\r\n“Just the captain. He gave it to me to fetch your meal.”\r\n\r\nWhen the boy left, she locked the door and stared at the delightful prospect of overcooked vegetables and boiled fish. The ship listed starboard, then to port, and the tray crashed upside down. Crouching to tidy the mess, she pushed the tray up against the wall, but eyed the wine. Still corked in a small glass bottle, Anne pulled out the stopper.\r\n\r\nShe scrunched her face when she held it to her nose. The sharp bouquet indicated its cheap vintage. She looked at the goblet that lay on its side, covered with white sauce. Shrugging, she held the bottle to her lips. ’Tis only me and perhaps it will take the edge off the sickness.\r\n\r\nAnne took a sip and let the tart liquid slide across her tongue. The wine tasted better than it smelled—though not a vintage Titchfield House would serve. Imagining she would need to become accustomed to a great many new experiences, she tilted the bottle and drank again. In no time, the wine warmed her insides and numbed the pain, both in her gut and in her heart.\r\n\r\nWhen the bottle was empty, she managed to remove her stomacher and untie her stays. It would be a long voyage without Hanna. Anne ran her fingers along her unbound ribs and shook out the skirts of her shift. Free of binding laces, she could finally breathe and crawl under the warmth of woolen bedclothes. She willed sleep to take her to a place where earl’s daughters were not traded for riches and lands.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAnne’s eyes flew open when a blast shook her awake. She swiped a hand across her forehead. Am I dreaming? The ship’s floorboards groaned, followed by a raucous thud and a shout. “Fire!” A roaring boom shook the galleon.\r\n\r\nCannons.\r\n\r\nHurried footsteps clamored overhead. The quartermaster bellowed commands, his voice high pitched and quick, like a rooster with its head on the block.\r\n\r\nHer skin prickled, she couldn’t breathe. The walls closed in.\r\n\r\nA cannon blast shook her bed. Heart hammering, Anne threw back the bedclothes and raced for her cabin door. She stumbled into the empty corridor. The ship rocked as she staggered toward the main deck. She braced her hands on the wall to keep herself upright.\r\n\r\nShe pushed the outer door, but it held fast. Leaning her shoulder into it, she shoved. A harsh gale caught it and flung the door open, sending her sprawling onto the deck.\r\n\r\nBlinking, Anne steadied herself on the rail. Raindrops splashed cold on her skin. Her shift clung to her legs like a flapping sail. Shivering, she pushed the hair from her face and peered into the darkness. Sailors scurried in every direction while the quartermaster delivered a ceaseless barrage of shouts. “Climb the crows nest with your musket, Davey boy…Ready your cutlasses men…Unfurl the jib…”\r\n\r\nHer heart nearly burst through her chest when an earsplitting boom lit up the sea less than a league away. She crouched and threw her arms over her head. A cannonball careened into the water mere feet from where she stood. Anne looked across the rail and ice filled her veins. A carrack bore down on them, flying a Jolly Roger—the unmistakable skull and crossbones of a pirate ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fortescue barreled down from the quarterdeck and threw an arm around Anne’s shoulder. “Get back to your cabin. Lock the door. Open it for no one.”\r\n\r\nShe leaned into his warmth. “We’re under attack?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll outrun them.”\r\n\r\n“But they’re on a course to cross our bow.”\r\n\r\nThe captain’s thin lips told her he was well aware of the pirate ship’s strategy. Outrunning the heavier carrack would not be an option. He strengthened his grip and led her back through the corridor. “Remember what I said. Lock. The. Door.”\r\n\r\nHe pushed Anne into her stateroom with such force, she stumbled against her trunk. She reached out and turned the lock with trembling fingers, then wrapped herself in her dressing gown, damp shift and all.\r\n\r\nThe galleon rocked beneath her feet. She turned full circle and hugged herself. Each breath shuddered. Being locked in her stateroom was far worse than standing on the deck. At least out there she could see what was happening. With every earsplitting blast, the ship quaked. Her trunks jostled. Water slapped against the hull, and her blood ran cold. She honestly could not swim.\r\n\r\nHow could the baron abandon me on a galleon with pirates sailing these waters? He most certainly has not appraised well in my eyes. The gutless miser will have much to answer for when I reach Alnwick. Leaving me alone without Hanna. And then there’s my uncle, the mastermind of this whole marriage scheme—curse him too!\r\n\r\nA cannon boomed. Anne’s entire body jolted. She dashed to her bed, her heart pummeling her chest.\r\n\r\nWhat if the brigands took the ship? Anne darted to her smallest trunk and threw back the lid. She pulled out an ornate wooden box and opened the hasp, then dumped the contents on the bed—her decree of marriage and the few precious jewels she owned. Using her fingernail to locate the string hidden in a groove, she pulled away the false bottom. Pushing aside the shillings, she stared at the ivory handle and slim blade of her father’s dagger.\r\n\r\nThe cannon volley reverberated through the ship. The acrid smell of sulfur wafted into her chamber. Anne’s stare shot to the ceiling. Feet pounded the floor above. Men screamed in agony.\r\n\r\nShe folded the marriage decree and replaced the false bottom, then shoved her precious keepsakes on top and stuffed it under her mattress. Jumping at an explosion that sounded like a cannonball crashing through the deck, Anne snatched up her knife and crouched upon the corner of her bed. Her gaze fixed on door, her seasickness replaced by uncontrollable trembling as the battle raged around her.\r\n\r\nSurely I will die this eve. Dear God, have mercy on my soul.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe unending night wore on with sounds of battle that Anne had only heard tale of, tucked away in Titchfield House. How she wanted to be back there now, in the arms of her sisters and Hanna.\r\n\r\nWhen the echoes of fighting stopped, an eerie hush filled her chamber. Anne sat up, gooseflesh rising on her arms. The knife in her hand slipped against her perspiration and she tightened her grip.\r\n\r\nFootsteps plodded down the wooden planks of the corridor. They stopped outside her door. The latch moved. Anne did not mistake the hiss of a sword being drawn from its scabbard. She drew in a ragged breath.\r\n\r\nSomething slammed into the door. Her heart flew to her throat. Another thud. Anne pressed her shoulders into the corner and steadied her knife. The door bowed and groaned against a clashing blow. Hinges gave way and the door clattered to the deck.\r\n\r\nA rugged man stared through the dimly lit doorway. Sword drawn, with a cropped copper beard, he glared at her with fierce, steely eyes. She was certain he could kill her with that look.\r\n\r\nAnne held up her knife, shaking like a sapling in the wind.\r\n\r\n“Holy Mother Mary.” He clattered across the door and sheathed his sword. “What in the blazes are ye doing here?”\r\n\r\nShe clasped her free hand over her knife to steady the trembling.\r\n\r\nHis shirt splattered with blood, his face dark, he took another step toward her, holding her gaze. “I’ll no’ hurt ye, lass.”\r\n\r\nAnne tried to push herself deeper into the corner, but the walls trapped her. He moved closer, his eyes searing into hers. She glanced beyond him, breaking his stare. His powerful legs strained against his red plaid kilt with one more step. Over the scents of sweat and blood, she caught the whiff of rosemary.\r\n\r\n“What is yer name?”\r\n\r\nName? What should I say? “A-Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Just Anne?”\r\n\r\nShe pursed her lips, unwilling to give him the satisfaction of knowing her true identity.\r\n\r\n“We-ell you’re no’ Anne Boleyn, that’s a certainty. She’s dead and her daughter’s on the throne.” His eyes glanced to the dagger trembling in her hand. “Ye think ye can take the likes of me with that wee knife?”\r\n\r\nHe towered over her little bed and Anne craned her neck. Her stomach squeezed. Those piercing eyes stared down at her from shoulders as broad as her largest trunk. He held out his hand. “Now be a good lass and give it to me.”\r\n\r\nShe licked her lips and stared at the blood staining his outstretched hand. Anne could not surrender without a fight. Gritting her teeth, she launched herself forward, aiming the dagger at his heart.	2014-07-17 13:58:08.47977	2014-07-17 13:58:08.47977
10	3	5	He snatched her wrist faster than she could blink.\r\n\r\nA sharp pain wrenched her wrist and the knife dropped to the floor. The Highlander shoved her back onto the bed and shook his head. “Now what did ye have to go and do that for? I told ye to hand it over.” He bent down and picked up the blade, turning it over in his hand appreciatively. “If you’re going to be hostile, I guess I’ll have to put it in me sporran for safekeeping.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced down to the white fur pouch he wore across the front of his kilt, watching as he slid her father’s dagger inside. “W-what did you do with Captain Fortescue?”\r\n\r\n“The former captain of this ship?” The Scot patted his sporran as if the pelt were ermine. “I’m afraid he’s on a wee boat headed back to shore.”\r\n\r\n“Of all the lawlessness. You mean to say that you tossed him overboard in a skiff?”\r\n\r\n“Aye. At least I didna kill the bastard. He was a darned bit ornery ’bout it too.”\r\n\r\n“You say that as if pillaging and casting the captain overboard was a minor inconvenience.”\r\n\r\nA shadow darkened his face. “Oh no, ’twas not minor at all.”\r\n\r\nAnne stiffened her back. All her life she’d heard “my lady” when addressed, but then, she hadn’t informed him of her title.\r\n\r\n“Actually, you’re the inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“Me?”\r\n\r\nHis finger twitched across the hilt of the gargantuan sword strapped to his hip. “Ye see, we’ve launched the skiffs and I’m at a loss as to what we should do with ye.”\r\n\r\nAnne’s mouth grew dry. Would he make her walk the plank? Would he take her to the hold and tie her down to be gnawed to death by the ship’s rats? A clammy chill swept over her skin. Surely, he would respect her virtue…wouldn’t he? “I-if you return me to Portsmouth, I should be able to find my way home.” She most assuredly was not going to continue on toward Alnwick or the baron.\r\n\r\n“Portsmouth, aye?” He took a seat at the end of her bed, putting Anne at eyelevel. “You would have us sail back into the mouth of the dragon herself, would ye?” He threw his head back and gave a hearty laugh, unlike someone bent on murder. “Nay. Ye will have to stay with us unsavory privateers for a wee bit longer.”\r\n\r\nAnne clutched her dressing gown tighter around her neck. Privateers? He’s a filthy pirate and a devilish one at that.\r\n\r\nA tall man in a dark green and blue kilt appeared in the doorway and spoke in a foreign tongue. Gaelic. She knew a little Gaelic. His eyes drifted to Anne and back to her captor, who responded in the same guttural tones—they’re talking about me. The pirate’s gaze softened when he turned to her. “John will see yer door is repaired.” He surveyed trunks that lined her wall. “I suppose all of these are yers?”\r\n\r\nThere rested the entirety of possessions. “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It looks like ye were planning to stay—wherever ye were going.”\r\n\r\nAnne stared at her hands and whispered, “Yes.”\r\n\r\nThe scent of rosemary grew stronger when the Highlander leaned in and eyed her. His rough fingers brushed a bronze brooch that clasped his plaid at his shoulder. “I take it ye weren’t too happy ’bout it.”\r\n\r\nAnne chose not to reply to the gentle tone in his voice. Her happiness was none of his concern, though in truth this diversion postponed wedded bliss with her antiquated baron.\r\n\r\n“Either way. Ye’ll be delayed for a bit.”\r\n\r\nHe headed toward the doorway, and she reached out a trembling hand. “Wait.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n“Where are you taking me?”\r\n\r\n“Northwest.”\r\n\r\nOf course he wouldn’t be specific. “What should I call you?”\r\n\r\nHe turned, his powerful frame outlined in the doorway by flickering firelight from above. Those blue eyes as fierce as they had looked when he first knocked down the door. “Captain.”\r\n\r\nDear God in heaven, praises to you that Hanna was not forced to endure this nightmare.\r\n\r\nAnne slipped back into her corner and clutched the pillow while he walked over the door and clomped though the corridor. The pirate did not have the decency to tell her his name. But then, she hadn’t been exactly forthcoming about hers either.\r\n\r\nWhat was she to do until her door was repaired? She tossed the pillow aside, and levered the door back into place. Using all her strength, she pushed and shoved one of her trunks until it blocked the entry. It wasn’t ideal, but would suffice to hold through the night. At least the racket would wake her if anyone tried to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalum pushed through to the captain’s cabin and turned full circle. The English hadn’t spared any expense on this new ship. A row of five leaded glass windows looked over the ship’s bow. In the center of the room stood a walnut table with six chairs upholstered in red with gold embroidery. A desk sat starboard with a thick leather-bound log atop. Port side, a bed hugged the dark paneling to hold firm during rough seas. Brass oil-burning lamps hung from the rafters to provide maximum light.\r\n\r\nCalum strolled to the aft windows and peered through one of the small glass panes. The sun touched the eastern horizon in violets and pinks. Soon they’d turn north for the journey home, but first they must make a wide berth around English waters. Once the captain and crew were found, there would be retribution. Of that he had no doubt.\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his eyes, unable to remember when he’d last slept. But sleep didn’t matter. He had secured the galleon, and its bounty would supply his people for months to come. The manifest of the cargo contained more than he’d dreamed with food aplenty, sheep, ponies and milking heifers, as well as fine cloth and a cache of hardwood for building.\r\n\r\nThe only thing he hadn’t counted on was Anne, a beautiful woman, truth be told. Expecting another fight, he’d nearly hurtled into her room and started swinging. Never before had a woman stopped him cold, but those almond-shaped eyes shone cobalt blue, just like the sky in the hour before night falls.\r\n\r\nShe’d looked fierce as a baby badger crouched in the corner of her bed holding that ridiculous knife—it was nearly too small to be called a dagger.\r\n\r\nWrapped in a red dressing gown, her honey-blonde mane had partly shrouded her face and cascaded all the way down to her enticing hips. Calum hadn’t been able to stop himself from mentally undressing her in that moment. Her hair draped across one eye gave her the appearance of a woman ready to be bedded. Fortunately, he’d recovered his wits when she tried to attack.\r\n\r\nCalum chuckled.\r\n\r\nHe needed only to look at the collection of trunks to know she was a lady of stature, and her accent had confirmed it. He groaned. Plundering a ship was one thing, but plundering a ship and kidnapping a highborn lady would buy him more trouble than he cared to bargain for. Anne. He must find out who she was so he could ransom her, and fast. A beautiful woman amongst his men would cause mayhem.\r\n\r\nAt a rap on the door, Calum turned. John entered holding the manifest. “All accounted for, m’laird.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent. And the lady’s door?”\r\n\r\n“The carpenters are working on it now.”\r\n\r\n“Very good.”\r\n\r\nJohn placed the paperwork on the table. “Who is the woman?”\r\n\r\n“She would only say that her name is Anne. But she’s English nobility, there’s no question.”\r\n\r\n“Have you checked the captain’s log?”\r\n\r\nCalum strode to the ornate desk and opened the large volume, thumbing the pages until he found the last entry. 25th March, Year of our Lord 1559. Set sail mid-afternoon. One passenger, Lady Anne, daughter of Lord Southampton, destination the River Aln. Clouds rolling in from the west. Rain likely.\r\n\r\nJohn peered over his shoulder. “Southampton—he’s an earl, no?”\r\n\r\n“He’s a dead earl. I think his heir’s but a child.”\r\n\r\nCalum pulled out the map of England and rolled it open on the table. “She’s headed toward the River Aln.” He ran his finger along the east coast until he found the said river and found the closest town. “Alnwick.”\r\n\r\n“The seat of the Earl of Northumberland,” John said.\r\n\r\n“The plundering bastard and his murdering sheriff, the Baron of Wharton.”\r\n\r\nJohn leaned in and studied the map. “Ye wouldn’t think she’d be tied up with the likes of them?”\r\n\r\n“And why not? Her da’s an earl.”\r\n\r\n“Bloody hell. The last thing we need is Wharton and his henchman bearing down on us.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a good thing our plaid looks like the Stewart’s. That’ll confuse the English until we can arrange terms for her ransom.” Calum rolled up the map. “I’ll have Lady Anne dine with me tonight to see what more I can pull from her.”\r\n\r\nJohn waggled his eyebrows. “Aye, and feast yer eyes no doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t let your shameless mind consider it. If she weren’t worth a farthing, I’d bloody well throw her arse over the side of the ship.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, Laird Calum, Robin Hood of Raasay—always willing to drown a lady in distress.”\r\n\r\n“She’s no lady to me. Be gone with ye.”\r\n\r\nCalum turned his back and closed his eyes. His palms perspired as he pictured the voluptuous Lady Anne, her full red lips trembling—undeniably kissable lips. He rubbed his palms against his plaid. Surely she would not be as alluring once she’d donned a proper gown and headpiece.	2014-07-17 13:58:40.094882	2014-07-17 13:58:40.094882
11	4	5	Anne stared at the door with its new hinges—and a lock she could not turn as before. Now a prisoner, she paced the room still wearing her shift and dressing gown. The night had been endless and carried on into a day trapped within. She’d heard about Scottish pirates who preyed on Her Majesty’s ships. Even one of her family’s cargoes of grain had been plundered by pirates. Whether it had been Scots or not, no one knew, but pirates were a thorn in England’s side, not only to the crown but to every landowner who shipped their goods abroad.\r\n\r\nAt the time, she’d reported the incident to the Privy Council and they assigned Captain Hawkins to the task. Hawkins. He was a known pirate himself.\r\n\r\nAnne balled her fists. The business of running her family’s estates was no longer her concern. She needed to find a way off this ship and back to her family. No—her mother had made clear, she must honor the contract of marriage. She must find a way to her husband. Thomas Wharton had earned his barony by his shrewd talent for law enforcement. Once the baron learned that his new wife had been captured by Scottish pirates, he would surely not rest until the savages were brought to justice.\r\n\r\nAside from being much older, Anne knew little of her new husband, but one thing was certain—he hated the Scots. News of his raids into Scotland had even reached Titchfield House.\r\n\r\nHer door opened with a light tap. “Excuse me, milady. The captain would like ye to dine with him this evening.” John, the second-in-charge, who’d repaired her door, wore a green and blue plaid opposed to the red and black the captain and the cabin boy who’d brought her food had worn.\r\n\r\nAnne lifted her chin. “I would prefer to take my meals in my stateroom.”\r\n\r\n“Trom féineil nighneag,” he cursed under his breath.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, but I am neither selfish nor burdensome.”\r\n\r\nAnne enjoyed watching the shocked bulge to John’s eyes when she translated his Gaelic. He fumbled with the latch. “I’ll be back to escort ye to the captain in an hour. I’d think with all these trunks ye would have more than a dressing gown to wear over yer shift.”\r\n\r\nHe closed the door and the lock clicked.\r\n\r\nAnne rushed forward and jerked on the handle. Blast them for caging me like I’m the one they cannot trust. When the pirate had first kicked in the door and entered her room, she’d been terrified, afraid he would kill her—a big man with a big sword, splattered with blood. Well, she knew differently now. The captain wanted to dine with her? Fine. She would use his misplaced hospitality to uncover more about him. Any information she could gather would assist Lord Wharton to capture the plunderer and his men.\r\n\r\nShe would dress the part for this meal. If the captain saw her in a gold silk gown—fabric reserved only for baronesses and above—he’d think twice about taking her back to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nIt took three times as long to dress without Hanna. Turning in front of the dingy looking glass, Anne inspected her handiwork. All ribbons were tied, though she’d had to lace up her stays in the front, but no strings stuck out. While she secured the matching headpiece in place, a knock sounded.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nOpening the door, John appraised her with a half-cocked smile. “Och. Looks like I’ll no’ have to strong arm ye to the captain’s cabin.”\r\n\r\n“You are brash, sir.” She stood as tall as her frame would allow. “I would still prefer to dine in my quarters.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis fortunate ye’ve reconsidered.” He offered her the crook of his arm. “Ye look lovely.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced to the mirror and caught a rosy flush crawling up her face. “I presume you’re expecting me to thank you.”\r\n\r\n“A lady generally does when a gentleman pays her a compliment.”\r\n\r\n“So you’re a gentleman now that you’ve pillaged the ship?”\r\n\r\nShe placed her hand on the elbow he’d offered and inclined her head toward the door.\r\n\r\n“We’re no’ as bad as ye think.”\r\n\r\nJohn ushered her into the captain’s quarters, lavishly inlaid with the rich warmth of walnut wood. The captain stood with his back to them, staring out the windows behind the table, elegantly set for two. He’d tied back his dark auburn hair and wore a clean linen shirt. Anne had forgotten how enormous he was—his broad shoulders tapered down to his waist, supported by slim hips beneath his red and black plaid.\r\n\r\nJohn bowed. “Her ladyship, m’laird.”\r\n\r\nThe captain turned. Anne’s breath caught. He’d cleaned the soot and blood from his face, but his eyes still bore through her like an arrow. She scarcely heard the door close behind her. He approached, his frown replaced by a smile, displaying a row of perfectly straight teeth.\r\n\r\nAnne forced herself to breathe. She wanted the dirty face with the scowl back—it was easier to detest that pirate.\r\n\r\n“Thank ye for coming, milady.”\r\n\r\nAnne’s hands trembled as he neared. No man had ever made her hands shake like that. She clenched her fists to stop the tremors. “My lady?” she asked. “I did not tell you I was nobly born.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, but the captain’s log did.”\r\n\r\nThe log? “Oh? And what did Captain Fortescue note about me?”\r\n\r\nAnne could not ignore how his muscles stretched his hose when he sauntered to the sideboard and poured two goblets of wine. “Ye can read it there on the desk if ye like, but he said you’re the daughter of Southampton, bound for the River Aln.”\r\n\r\n“I see.” She walked over to the bound volume smoothed her hands down the coarse velum. The entry made no mention of her marriage by proxy. Interesting.\r\n\r\nHe handed her the goblet. “Wine?”\r\n\r\nShe looked him in the eye and her heart stuttered. Gold flecks danced around rims of blue. She snapped her gaze to the goblet. “Thank you.”\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a chair. “Please, sit. I trust ye have been treated well since our last...ah…encounter?”\r\n\r\nShe stepped toward him and ignored the chair. She caught the familiar bouquet of rosemary soap, though not mixed with blood and sweat this time. “If you call locking me in my stateroom good treatment, then yes.”\r\n\r\nThe narrowing of his eyes reflected annoyance, but he politely bowed and gestured for her to sit. “Apologies. Your confinement was more for yer sake than to keep ye imprisoned.”\r\n\r\nWhen he helped her push in her chair, his hand brushed her shoulder. A tingle trickled down Anne’s spine, though she suppressed her gasp. Her gaze drifted to his hand—large, strong, sprinkled with coppery hair. He was quite unlike what she’d imagined for a pirate captain.\r\n\r\nHe took his seat at the head of the table—a foot away, close enough for her to touch him. He smiled again, white teeth, fetching as the devil.\r\n\r\nShe studied the silver salt cellar and nervously tapped it to the exact center of the table. Why does he have to be wickedly handsome? On the few times Anne had been to court, there had been good looking men, but none so imposing as the captain. He had lines at the corners of his gold flecked blue eyes, as if he often squinted directly into the bright sun. His nose was not subtle, but the size and slight hook to it suited him. The nose alone announced this was not a man to trifle with. And his hands…They were large and powerful, but the nails were now clean and neatly trimmed, and in his hands, an elegant brass goblet was held utterly secure.\r\n\r\nHer gaze trailed down to the laces of his shirt and tight heat coiled deep inside when she spied the auburn curls peeking just above his neckline. For no reason at all, she had an urge to touch him—to discover if those curls were as downy soft as they looked.\r\n\r\n“Is my appearance displeasing?”\r\n\r\n“N-no.” Anne glanced behind her, hoping the food would come soon so this meal would be over and she could escape back to her chamber.\r\n\r\n“I will see to it ye have leave to walk the deck.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded, not trusting her voice.\r\n\r\nShe sipped her wine again and studied the ruby liquid within. She could feel his boring eyes upon her, assessing her as she had done him. She dared glance at him and those blues caught hers. He smiled. Again, her cheeks burned.\r\n\r\n“Am I making ye nervous, milady?”\r\n\r\n“Yes…er, no.” Where is the food?\r\n\r\nAs if answering her thought, the side door opened and the cabin boy brought in pewter plates filled with roast meat and vegetables.\r\n\r\n“Thank ye, Bran.”\r\n\r\nThe boy bowed. “Will there be anything else, m’laird?”\r\n\r\nThe captain arched his brow her way, and Anne shook her head. “That will be all for now. Go eat yer supper, lad.”\r\n\r\nHe reached for a basket of bread and offered it to Anne.\r\n\r\n“That is the second time I’ve heard to you referred to as laird.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, ’tis what me clansmen call their chieftain.”\r\n\r\n“Chieftain?” She grasped a slice of bread. “So you are a Scottish laird?”\r\n\r\n“Aye.”\r\n\r\n“Of which clan?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, milady, I cannot say.”\r\n\r\n“Must I always call you Captain? I find it quite uncivilized that I am sitting at the table of a man whose name I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Calum.”\r\n\r\n“Calum?” She liked the simplicity of it. “Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“For the moment.” He leaned toward her and winked. “Now ye have to tell me something.”\r\n	2014-07-17 14:00:22.361744	2014-07-17 14:00:22.361744
12	1	6	AMANDINE MONROE LLOYD SAT with her legs pressed together and ankles crossed in Dr. Silverman’s office. The good doctor had a prosperous practice in Los Angeles, catering to the significant others of the rich and famous. The waiting room was decorated in soothing sage and creamy yellow, just like the office. Instead of posters warning women about the dangers of various illnesses, the clinic walls had tasteful prints of modern art, the kind that people in Amandine’s husband’s social circle would easily drop a few million dollars to own. If they had been the originals, of course.\r\n\r\nUntil her marriage, she’d never been able to afford a gynecologist who had a private practice, much less one as high-class as Dr. Silverman’s. She squirmed in her seat. Her pink chiffon Oscar de la Renta dress and matching Manolo Blahnik stilettos cost more than what most people made in a month and should have been enough to make her feel like she belonged in the office. But they were something her personal shopper—one her husband had hired—had bought to ensure she looked the part of Mrs. Gavin Lloyd. She would never have spent that much on something she’d end up wearing only once or twice, but her shopper bought something new every other day. Maybe the woman was trying to compensate for the fact that Amandine didn’t want her clothes custom-tailored in Europe like Gavin.\r\n\r\nShe studied the little pots of aloe on the window sill, counting their spiky leaves. What could be taking Dr. Silverman so long?\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, the doctor walked in and took her seat at the desk. In her early forties, Dr. Silverman was model-thin and short—shorter than Amandine’s five-five—with a friendly face and warm green eyes. She wore a white doctor’s lab coat over a peach tunic and a skirt as brown as her hair. Her shoes were sensible pumps, unlike Amandine’s impractical stilettos.\r\n\r\n“Congratulations again.” She handed Amandine a discreet ivory envelope made of expensive paper. There was nothing on the outside except the clinic’s logo. “Here’s the sonogram so you can share it with your husband. I’m sure he’ll be thrilled.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.” Amandine put it in her purse, her hands less than steady. She and Gavin had never discussed having children. But it’d been three years since they’d gotten married, so wasn’t it about time they thought about the next generation?\r\n\r\nOkay, so their third anniversary was tomorrow. Almost three years.\r\n\r\n“By the way…” Amandine began.\r\n\r\nDr. Silverman put her hands together. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Does it matter that we used birth control all this time?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Is the baby” —Amandine put a hand on her belly— “going to have a problem because of that?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Don’t worry. No birth control works one hundred percent of the time. But that doesn’t mean that pregnancies occurring during usage aren’t viable, or that your baby will run a higher risk for any particular condition.”\r\n\r\n“Okay.”\r\n\r\n“The most important thing for you right now is to relax, eat healthy and do some light exercise three to four times a week,” the doctor said, ticking off the points on her fingers. “The receptionist will give you a booklet with everything you need to know. It has two copies of Nutrition, one for you and one for your staff. I’m sure your cook can come up with something acceptable based on my recommendations. If you need more information or have any other concerns or questions, feel free to contact me at any time.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks.” The reassurance made her feel a little better. Gavin paid a hefty fee every year to ensure that Amandine could remain a patient at the private concierge service clinic, and unlike some physicians, Dr. Silverman really was available at all times via phone, email or text.\r\n\r\n“I want to do another exam in two weeks. Please see the receptionist to schedule your next visit.”\r\n\r\n“I will.”\r\n\r\n“Again, congratulations.”\r\n\r\nAmandine walked out of the office and into the waiting area. Her best friend and personal assistant Brooke de Lorenzo rose from the comfortable white leather couch. She had on an eye-popping outfit, as usual; this one consisted of a sleeveless magenta top, a teal mini-skirt and a golden loop belt. The top was slightly loose, but the skirt was tight enough to show off her butt, the “spoils of the gym” as she called it. Big gold hoops dangled from her ears, her short sassy bob framing a pretty face. Her black platform boots moved silently over the carpeted floor as she approached, two bags hanging from one of her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Everything good?” she asked, her eyes level with Amandine’s. The two of them were the same height, and today so was their footwear.\r\n\r\n“No problems.”\r\n\r\n“Great. When do you want your next appointment?” She pulled out a tablet.\r\n\r\n“Two weeks from now.”\r\n\r\nShe conferred with the receptionist and nodded. “Okay. Ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\nThe receptionist tried to hand Brooke a card with the time written on it, but she waved it away. “Got it.” She flashed the fancy tablet and put it in one of the bags.\r\n\r\nBrooke and Amandine walked into the elevator together. “I should call Gavin.” Amandine wanted to tell Brooke the news, but of course her husband should be first.\r\n\r\n“Okay.” Brooke waited until they reached the lobby, then dialed his number and handed the phone to Amandine.\r\n\r\n“You know you don’t have to do phone duty, right?” Amandine said, pressing the stylish gadget to her ear and walking toward her car.\r\n\r\n“Gotta earn my keep.”\r\n\r\n“I keep you plenty busy with more important things. Like organizing yet another charity function.” Amandine hated fundraisers, but it was something she realized she needed to do as Gavin’s wife. She wasn’t an art teacher anymore.\r\n\r\nGavin picked up on the fifth ring. “Hey, sweetie,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I have—”\r\n\r\n“I’m in the middle of something. Is it urgent or can I call you back?” he asked, speaking fast.\r\n\r\nDid her pregnancy qualify as “urgent?” It might be better to wait until he had some time to digest the news. “Later is fine. Call me.”\r\n\r\n“’Kay, bye.”\r\n\r\nShe handed the phone back to Brooke with a sigh. “He’s busy.”\r\n\r\n“He’s always busy. You should’ve told him you want to talk now.” Brooke peered at Amandine. “If you’re calling him, it must be important.”	2014-07-17 14:02:46.259312	2014-07-17 14:02:46.259312
13	2	6	“It’s okay.” She should’ve known better than to call during the workday.\r\n\r\nBrooke took the driver’s seat of the pearly Mercedes coupe Gavin had bought for Amandine on her last birthday and put on a pair of oversized sunglasses. They were shaped like butterfly wings. “I’ll drive. You just relax.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Amandine said, shoving some more conservative shades onto her own face. Brooke was one of the best drivers she knew. That was the only reason she’d been able to convince Gavin not to hire a chauffeur.\r\n\r\n“So what is it? Not cancer or anything, right?”\r\n\r\nAmandine choked, then started coughing. “Of course not. Why would you even think—?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t give me that. You looked totally shell-shocked coming out of the doctor’s office.” Brooke’s short but artfully manicured green fingernails tapped the steering wheel. “And you hardly ever call Gavin at work.”\r\n\r\nAmandine hesitated, then blurted, “I’m pregnant.”\r\n\r\n“Wow! Seriously? Congratulations! I didn’t know you guys were planning to start a family.”\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t.” She’d been wanting a family, a couple of children at least to fill their huge mansion, but somehow it had never come up. “I mean, we weren’t.”\r\n\r\n“Uh-huh.”\r\n\r\nAmandine looked at the semi-congested road ahead and sighed. “I’m just a little worried is all. Gavin’s never said he wanted kids.”\r\n\r\n“You should think about what you want, too. That’s what being a couple means, right?” Brooke made a deft turn onto a smaller street with fewer motorists and accelerated. “Anyway, it’ll probably work out.”\r\n\r\n“How? Gavin hardly ever has time to spend with me anymore. How will he make time for a child?”\r\n\r\n“He’ll figure it out. Children have a way of changing your priorities.” Brooke paused. “You know Sandy and Eugene?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. They had a girl last year.” Amandine had sent a large basket of baby goods, with the help of her shopper, Josephine, who’d gone wild in various boutiques, selecting all sorts of cute little things. The woman knew quality, and Amandine had wanted the best for Brooke’s older sister’s first-born.\r\n\r\n“Okay, you can’t tell anybody, but…they were thinking about separating.”\r\n\r\nShock shot through Amandine. “Are you serious? They seem so in love.”\r\n\r\n“Sandy’s not the type to air her dirty laundry in public, but believe me, they were having problems. Fighting about all sorts of stupid stuff all the time…they’d just about decided it wasn’t worth it, even though a divorce would’ve killed the parents.”\r\n\r\n“It must’ve been pretty serious for Sandy to risk disappointing your father.”\r\n\r\nBrooke glanced heavenward. “Oh my god, you have no idea.”\r\n\r\nBrooke and Sandy’s father had raised his two daughters alone after his wife’s death, working himself to the bone to provide for them. Amandine had spent some time with him when all of them were younger. Though he was one of the nicest people she knew, in some ways he was also one of the most conservative. He wanted his family to be together and happy, and for his elder daughter to divorce would have been a huge blow. Amandine had a feeling that Eugene’s parents were similar.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, the pregnancy changed everything. All of a sudden all the little stuff just didn’t seem that important in comparison to this new life and they, you know, kind of re-set their relationship for the sake of the child. And it worked out.” Brooke’s lips twisted in a wry smile. “I imagine they took their counseling and stuff more seriously too, once there was more at stake. So Gavin might do the same, feeling all responsible and fatherly. Which of course means he’ll be home more.”\r\n\r\n“Or he’ll just hire an army of nannies.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll probably do that too, but his family’s really big on children. All those family gatherings? I can’t imagine Gavin being any different. You see how he treats his nephew, making time for him no matter what.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true.” Gavin adored his nephew and spoiled the boy rotten whenever he got the chance. Why would he love his own child any less?\r\n\r\n“Who knows? Maybe he’ll indulge the kid so much you’ll end up wanting to kill him for undermining your authority.” They both laughed as Brooke brought the coupe to a stop in front of the heavy wrought-iron gates that marked the entrance to Gavin and Amandine’s estate. She entered the security code into a number pad and placed her thumb against the fingerprint scanner. The gates slid open as the security system accepted her access credentials, and the Mercedes started the long winding drive to the main door of the mansion.\r\n\r\nAmandine thought, Wouldn’t that be great? She’d rather have Gavin be a doting, overindulgent father than a neglectful one. That way their child would know it was loved unconditionally. She wouldn’t mind playing bad cop and taking responsibility for disciplining the kid.\r\n\r\n“Smile and have happy thoughts.” Brooke stopped the car in front of the pale cream marble steps that led up to the main doors. White ionic columns topped by Corinthian capitals stood sentry on either side. “I sent Luna a text, so I’m sure she’s got something nutritious already made. I’ll put the car in the garage and meet you in the dining room. Don’t forget; you’ve got a meeting with the Art4Kids Foundation board at 2:30.”\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAround midnight a black Bentley pulled to a stop in front of the mansion and Gavin emerged from the rear. “Thanks, Thomas.”\r\n\r\n“My pleasure, sir. Good night.”\r\n\r\nGavin watched as the car traveled along the long looping driveway and disappeared around the curve that led to the garage in the back. Thomas worked a hectic schedule to accommodate Gavin’s even crazier one. But in the eight years he’d been on the staff he’d never once complained about the hours. Fortunately for everyone, Thomas had an understanding wife who appreciated the generous pay and benefits that allowed her to be a stay-at-home mom.\r\n\r\nGavin remembered that the youngest of their three children was autistic. Thomas should get a big Christmas bonus and raise for the next fiscal year. He’d earned it, and his family would put it to good use.\r\n\r\nOnly one lamp was lit by the door. There used to be more lights in the evening, but Amandine had thought it wasteful.\r\n\r\n“Darling, we can afford it,” Gavin had told her.\r\n\r\n“Still… Let’s not be frivolous with electricity.”\r\n\r\nSo one light it was. He didn’t mind. Whatever made her happy was fine by him.\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door. Their housekeeper, Luna, didn’t come out to greet him. She never stayed past dinner-time unless he or Amandine specifically requested it. He walked up the winding steps to the master bedroom suite on the second level, his dress shoes clattering on the cool marble floor.\r\n\r\nThe master bedroom suite was what had sold Gavin on the mansion five years earlier. The room was big, with three ceiling fans and windows that looked out to the green and lush garden surrounding the house. He’d had the walk-in closet and bathroom redone before moving in. After the marriage, he’d told Amandine to redecorate if she wanted, but she’d declined, saying everything was already perfect.\r\n\r\nA night-light provided just enough illumination for him to see inside the bedroom. Amandine was curled up in bed, her breathing deep and even. She looked so small and vulnerable in sleep. Carrying his shoes, he walked across the freshly waxed hardwood floor carefully, trying not to wake her up. He slipped inside the big walk-in closet, shed his clothes and went into the bathroom to brush his teeth.	2014-07-17 14:03:56.525912	2014-07-17 14:03:56.525912
14	1	7	Joseph Alton practiced as a board-certified Obstetrician and Pelvic Surgeon for more than 25 years before retiring to devote his efforts to preparing families medically for any scenario. He is a Fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American College of Surgeons, served as department chairman at local hospitals and as an adjunct professor at local university nursing schools. He is a contributor to well-known preparedness magazines and is frequently invited to speak at survival and preparedness conferences throughout the country on the subject of medical readiness. A member of MENSA, Dr. Alton collects medical books from the 19th century to gain insight on off-the-grid medical protocols.\r\n\r\nAmy Alton is an Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner and a Certified Nurse-Midwife. She has had years of experience working in large teaching institutions as well as smaller, family-oriented hospitals. Amy has extensive medicinal herb and vegetable gardens and works to include natural remedies into her strategies.\r\n\r\nDr. and Ms. Alton are devoted aqua culturists (currently raising tilapia) and aquaponic, raised bed, and container gardening experts. As “Dr. Bones and Nurse Amy”, they host a medical preparedness website at www.doomandbloom.net, and produce video and radio programs under the Doom and BloomTM label. Dr. and Ms. Alton are firm believers that, to remain healthy in hard times, we must use all the tools in the medical woodshed. Their goal is to promote integrated medicine; in this way, they can offer their readers the most options to keep their loved ones healthy in a long-term survival situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we first embarked on the adventure of writing the first edition of this book, “The Doom and BloomTM Survival Medicine Handbook”, we were overwhelmed by the challenge that confronted us. Although there was a wealth of information about the occasional few of injury on a wilderness hike, books considered the possibility a setting so remote or devastated that NO hope of modern medical care existed for the long term. Even books that were meant for in third world environments often ended their use to get to modern medical chapters by exhorting their readers care as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe realized that we were in uncharted territory. Our concern was the major catastrophe that isolated a family from modern medicine for the long term. Trained personnel would not exist in this scenario, or would be overwhelmed by the demand for their services. What does a mother or father do in this circumstance? How would they deal with injuries or sickness? What could we, as medical professionals, do to improve their family’s chances of surviving and staying healthy?\r\n\r\nWe decided that a how-to manual in plain English was the best option. We had to put together a strategy for each medical issue that we felt a head of household would encounter in times in trouble. It had to be simple. It had to make use of limited resources in a sustainable manner. It had to be realistic.\r\n\r\nThe last part was the hardest. It’s difficult to make people believe that a head injury or a gunshot wound to the chest may not be survivable. No one wants to return to a time when, for example, pregnancy was a major cause of death. It’s painful to think about, but we must face the hard truth, sometimes.\r\n\r\nSo we looked at every individual medical problem we could think of. How could we teach a non-medical person how to approach that problem in simple fashion? We considered what medical supplies they would need, how to use them, and how to replace them, when possible, with natural alternatives. More importantly, we figured out ways to best prevent medical problems.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t easy. Many times, we had to dig back into our collection of 19th century medical books to find methods that would be useful in grid-down situations. These methods weren’t superior to what modern medicine has to offer; as a matter of fact, some are downright obsolete. Despite this, we found a number of ways that our great grandparents used that might be of benefit in a long term survival setting.\r\n\r\nWhen the book was published, we expected that, perhaps, a couple of hundred people might obtain it. A year later, tens of thousands have the book in their possession. The book has received acclaim and it has received criticism; luckily for us, more of the former than the latter.\r\n\r\nThis 2nd Edition covers more issues that the first book, and covers almost every subject in more detail. The book updates a number of areas of the first book with new strategies that we have devised for various problems. Every section has been amended in some way; some a little, some a lot.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this book will serve as a useful reference to the average family. The person that will accept responsibility for their family’s medical well-being in uncertain times is a very special person. We hope that we have provided a tool for their goal: To succeed, even if everything else fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost outdoor medicine guides are intended to aid you in managing emergency situations in austere and remote locations. Certainly, modern medical care on an ocean voyage or wilderness hike is not readily available; even trips to the cities of underdeveloped countries may fit this category as well.\r\n\r\nThere are medical strategies for these mostly short term scenarios that are widely published, and they are both reasonable and effective. An entire medical education system exists to deal with limited wilderness or disaster situations, and it is served by a growing industry of supplies and equipment. You expect, not unreasonably, that the rescue helicopter is already on the way.	2014-07-17 14:12:28.068028	2014-07-17 14:12:28.068028
15	2	7	What is your goal when an emergency occurs in a remote setting? The basic premise of “wilderness” or “disaster” medicine is to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluate the injured or ill patient.\r\n\r\nStabilize their condition.\r\n\r\nTransport the individual to the nearest modern hospital, clinic, or emergency care center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis series of steps makes perfect sense; you are not a physician and, somewhere, there are facilities that have a lot more technology than you have in your backpack. Your priority is to get the patient out of immediate danger and then ship them off; this will allow you to continue on your wilderness adventure. Transporting the injured person may be difficult to do (sometimes very difficult), but you still have the luxury of being able to ”pass the buck” to those who have more knowledge, technology and supplies. And why not? You aren’t a medical professional, after all.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, there may come a time when a pandemic, civil unrest or terrorist event may precipitate a situation where the miracle of modern medicine may be unavailable. Indeed, not only unavailable, but even to the point that the potential for access to modern facilities no longer exists.\r\n\r\nWe refer to this type of long-term scenario as a “collapse”. In a collapse, you will have more risk for illness and injury than on a hike in the woods, yet little or no hope of obtaining more advanced care than you, yourself, can provide. It’s not a matter of a few days without modern technology, such as after a hurricane or tornado. Help is NOT on the way; therefore, you have become the place where the “buck” stops for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nFew are prepared to deal with the harsh reality of a long-term survival situation. To go further, very few are willing to even entertain the possibility that such a tremendous burden might be placed upon them. Even for those stalwarts that are willing, there are few, if any, books that will consider this drastic turn of events. Yet, the likelihood of your exposure to such a situation, at some point in your life, may not be so small. It stands to reason, therefore, that some medical education might be useful in times of trouble.\r\n\r\nAlmost all handbooks (some quite good) on wilderness or third world medicine will usually end a section with: “Go to the hospital immediately”. Although this is excellent advice for modern times, it won’t be very helpful in an uncertain future when the hospitals might all be out of commission. We only have to look at Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to know that even modern medical facilities may be useless if they are understaffed, under-supplied, and overcrowded.\r\n\r\nUnwittingly, the majority of the citizens in New Orleans became their own medical care providers in the aftermath of the storm. With medical assistance teams overwhelmed, no one was coming to the aid of one injured or ill individual when thousands needed help at once. Each household became the “end of the line” when it came to its own well-being.\r\n\r\nIf you become the end of the line with regards to the medical well-being of your family or group, there are certain adjustments that have to be made. Medical supplies must be accumulated to deal with varied emergencies. Medical knowledge must be obtained, shared, and assimilated. These medical supplies and skills must then be adjusted to fit the mindset that you must adopt in a collapse: That things have changed for the long term, and that you are the sole medical resource when it comes to keeping your people healthy.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge responsibility. Many, when confronted, will decide that they cannot bear the burden of being in charge of the medical care of others. Others, however, will find the fortitude to grit their teeth and wear the badge of survival “medic”. These individuals may have some medical experience, but most will simply be fathers and mothers who understand that someone must be appointed to handle things when medical help is NOT on the way.\r\n\r\nIf this reality first becomes apparent when a loved one becomes deathly ill, the likelihood that you will have the training and supplies needed to be an effective medical provider will be close to zero. This is a sure way to assure that, when everything else fails, you will, too.\r\n\r\nThis volume is meant to educate and prepare those who want to ensure the health of their loved ones. If you can absorb the information here, you will be better equipped to handle 90% of the emergencies that you will see in a power-down scenario. As well, you will have a realistic view of what medical issues are survivable without modern facilities.\r\n\r\nThese realities may place you between a rock and a hard place. Over time, you will certainly have to make difficult decisions. With this book, we hope to give you the tools to arrive at choices that will increase your chances of successfully treating injuries and disease.\r\n\r\nAll the information contained in this book is meant for use in a post-apocalyptic setting, when modern medicine no longer exists. If your leg is broken in five places, it stands to reason that you’ll do better in an orthopedic hospital ward than with a splint made out of two sticks and strips of a T-shirt.\r\n\r\nThe strategies discussed here are not the most effective means of taking care of certain medical problems. In fact, some of them are straight out of the last century. They adhere to the philosophy that something is better than nothing; in a survival situation, that “something” might just get you through the storm. As Theodore Roosevelt once said, “You must do what you can, with what you have, where you are”.\r\n\r\nHopefully, societal destabilization will never happen. This book is a weapon against, not an argument for, an end of the world scenario. If we never encounter a long-term survival situation, this book will still have its uses. Natural catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina will always rear their ugly heads.\r\n\r\nThese events are inevitable at one point or another, and will tax even the most advanced medical delivery systems. Medical personnel will be unlikely to be readily available to help you if they are overwhelmed by mass casualties.\r\n\r\nEven a few days without access to health care may be fatal in an emergency. The information provided here will be valuable while you are waiting for help to arrive. With some medical knowledge and supplies, you may gain precious time for an injured loved one and aid in their recovery.\r\n\r\nAn important caveat: In most locales, the practice of medicine or dentistry without a license is against the law. None of the recommendations in this book will protect you from liability if you implement them where there is a functioning government and legal system. Consider obtaining formal medical education if you want to become a healthcare provider in a pre-collapse society. All it takes is your time, energy, and dedication.\r\n\r\nAlthough you will not be a physician after reading this volume, you will certainly be more of a medical asset to your family, group, or community than you were before. Among other things, you will have:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearned to think about what to do when you become the end of the line in terms of your family’s medical well-being.\r\n\r\nConsidered preventative medicine and sanitation.\r\n\r\nLooked at your environment to see what plants might have medicinal value.\r\n\r\nPut together a medical kit which, along with standard equipment, includes traditional medications and natural remedies.\r\n\r\nThought about how to improvise in an austere setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost importantly, you will have become medically prepared to face the very uncertain future; and after all, isn’t that what you wanted to accomplish when you first picked up this book?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part of this preface described this and other books that might be helpful in scenarios that might occur as a result of the aftermath of a major disaster or long-term catastrophe. The information in this book will be useful to those preparing for those events. It might also be helpful in a remote setting for those who have to fend for themselves for long periods of time.	2014-07-17 14:13:40.144929	2014-07-17 14:13:40.144929
16	3	7	This book will not meet the needs of certain people. If you are already a doctor or formally-trained medical professional, you will feel that some of the information in this book is below your pay grade.\r\n\r\nYou would be right, as this book is not primarily intended for you. It is meant for the non-medical professional who is concerned about keeping their family healthy when trained personnel, such as yourself, are no longer around.\r\n\r\nThis book might have some use, however, for the flexibly-minded medical pro. In a long-term survival situation, medical personnel will not have the luxury of “Stabilize and Transport” and will have to adjust their mindset. This book is of that mindset already. It might be helpful for some who would ordinarily transport a patient out: It might make them think about how to prepare for when they might be the highest medical resource left.\r\n\r\nThe book does not claim to be a comprehensive review of every topic covered in it. Don’t expect, for example, 50 pages on how to treat Athlete’s Foot between its covers.\r\n\r\nAs well, this book is not meant for the person who expects to perform advanced medical procedures in the wilderness or any other power-down survival setting. You will not learn how to perform a cardiac bypass by reading this book, nor will you be learning how to successfully re-attach an amputated leg.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, this book is realistic, and does not claim to cure problems that only modern technology will help. Having said this, you will still be able to deal with the majority of survivable issues you will encounter in an austere setting.\r\n\r\nThis book is about integrated medicine, so if you are dead set against either conventional or alternative methods of healing, you will not be happy with this book. This book often bucks the conventional medical wisdom; at the same time, it is suspect of alternative claims that a particular substance is a cure-all for every disease. This book looks at what is likely to be of benefit in emergency situations with limited supplies. With it, you’ll have the best chance of maintaining the long-term health of a family or community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nDEDICATIONS\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\r\n\r\nPREFACE: THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n• TAKING RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\n• WHAT THIS BOOK ISN’T\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION: ARE YOU NORMAL?\r\n\r\nSECTION 1: PRINCIPLES OF MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\n• DOOM AND BLOOM VS.

TERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s say a man with a microphone comes up to you. He says:\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir (or madam), may I ask you a question? Are you normal?”\r\n\r\nSeems like such a simple question, doesn’t it? It’s a rare individual who believes that they’re not normal. You’d probably give him a strange look and walk on. The truth, however, is that the answer is not as simple as it seems.	2014-07-17 14:14:12.512482	2014-07-17 14:14:12.512482
17	4	7	Okay, then, let’s talk a little about “normal” people. The word “normal” has several definitions, but we’ll focus on two:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Standard, average or conforming to the group”, and…\r\n\r\n“Sane”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Normal” people have certain characteristics that would match the above. You’d agree, I’m sure, that “normal folks” need a level of organization in their life. They don’t want a lot of clutter, so they make sure to keep no more than 3 days’ supply of food in the pantry. They wait until the gas tank is nearly empty to refill it, and have no medical supplies other than a few Band-Aids and some aspirin in the medicine cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhenever there’s a crisis, whether it’s national (like the 9/11 attacks) or personal (like losing a job), they see before them just a bump on the road. When they stumble, they pick themselves up, brush the dirt off, and continue on their merry way as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nNormal folk don’t feel that there are lessons to be learned by current events. A major storm is just a news story or a chance to play some board games with the kids. This is because they are confident that others will resolve all their problems.\r\n\r\nThey pay taxes, so they believe the government will step in and give them a helping hand whenever they need it. The help could be in the form of food stamps in hard financial times, in swift emergency responses in natural calamities or in efficient and effective intervention in areas of civil unrest. Most people believe wholeheartedly that help will always be on the way, even if they have personally experienced a disaster situation.\r\n\r\nVarious surveys prove that this is the “normal” thinking of most people in civilized countries. Given the definition of “normal” listed above, this attitude certainly is “standard” and conforms to the group, but is it “sane”?\r\n\r\nLet’s take the case of essential personnel for any municipality. This would include police officers, firefighters, emergency medical techs, etc. These are the emergency responders that “normal” folks expect to get them out of a crisis. But what would really happen?\r\n\r\nIn surveys performed in several cities’ police precincts and fire stations, many public servants we depend upon have indicated that they will NOT report in the case of a truly serious catastrophe. The same goes for various other essential personnel, such as doctors, nurses, and paramedics.\r\n\r\nUnthinkable? To some, perhaps; however, the professional that we count on to rescue us in times of trouble also have wives, husbands, parents, and children. Who do you think they will rush to protect in a horrendous emergency, you or their own families? This is just a simple fact of life, and not a criticism of the brave men and women who keep us safe.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans Police Department surveyed those law enforcement officers who did not report for duty. Although some, indeed, were victims of the catastrophe, most cited their families as the reason for their absence. To expect them to do their duty and, at the same time, leave their own loved ones at risk might be standard and “normal” in our society, but it certainly isn’t “sane”.\r\n\r\nSo how do “normal” people become “sane” people? By realizing that society can be fragile and there are events that may occur to send the world into disarray. Once things happen that knock us off-kilter, a downward spiral will make life difficult. Certainly, it will be a challenge for all, but less so for that small minority known as “Preppers” or “The Preparedness Community”.\r\n\r\nPreppers are what we call people who stockpile food and supplies for use in a societal upheaval. They also take time to re-learn skills largely lost to modern urbanites/suburbanites; skills that would be useful if modern conveniences are no longer available.\r\n\r\nWhat types of events could cause such a collapse to happen? There are various scenarios that could lead to times of trouble: Flu pandemics, terrorist attacks, solar flares, and economic collapse are just some of the possible calamities that could befall a community, a region or even a country. The likelihood of any one of these life-changing occurrences may be very small, but what is the chance that NONE of these events will occur over the course of your lifetime? Your children’s lifetimes?\r\n\r\nThe preparedness community (perhaps 3% of the population) understands that there could be storm clouds on the horizon. Unlike the oblivious majority, they face perilous circumstances with a “can-do” attitude. It can be argued that they are the “normal ones”. Even though they are not “conforming to the group”, they are more “sane” than their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nInstead of facing an uncertain future with fear and desperation, the preparedness community is using this opportunity to learn new skills that can get them through any catastrophe. Many of these skills were common knowledge to their ancestors, such as growing food and using natural products for medicinal uses.\r\n\r\nBy learning things that are useful in a power-down situation, they increase the likelihood that they and their loved ones will succeed if, heaven forbid, everything else fails. If a calamitous scenario transpires, they will be prepared for the worst, even while hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nSome documentaries have portrayed Preppers as clad in camouflage, armed to the teeth, and hunkered down in some foxhole. For the grand majority of them, this could not be farther from the truth. The self-reliant nation is not eagerly waiting for some terrible series of events to bring society down. They want nothing more than to die at age 100, with their grandchildren whispering in their ear: “Gee, Grandpa, what the heck are we going to do with all these supplies?”\r\n\r\nThey view their preparations as insurance. You buy health insurance, but that doesn’t mean you want to get sick; you buy life insurance, but you certainly don’t want to die. Being prepared is insurance as well. Instead of paying money for something that isn’t tangible, you’re buying food, medical supplies, and other things that will ensure that you and your loved ones will do well regardless of what slings and arrows life may throw at you.\r\n\r\nThe road to self-reliance is a long and winding one. It will take some of your time and some of your energy to become self-sufficient. It will take some of your money, as well, to accumulate things that will be useful in obtaining a head start to success in dark times. This can be done frugally; a 50 pound bag of rice, for example, is still under $20 at the time of this writing.\r\n\r\nMany of the products that will be useful in a collapse scenario can also be improvised. A bandanna and a stick will be almost as good a tourniquet as a high-tech, commercially manufactured one. Look at what you have in your home and consider the ways that an item can be used in a survival situation.\r\n\r\nA realistic assessment of your storage will give you a good idea of how prepared you are for an unforeseen event. Where are you deficient? What purchases or improvisations will offer you the best opportunity to be ready? What skills would be useful to learn?\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin once said: “When the well is dry, we learn the worth of water”. The same can be said of many aspects of modern technology. If you are thrown into a situation where there is no electric power, how many items in your house will be useless? Quite a few, I suspect.\r\n\r\nThus, it stands to reason that, among other things, you should consider the ways that you will produce power. For most people, there are a few un-rechargeable batteries in a drawer somewhere. This may get you a few hours’ worth of flashlight or radio use, but what then? It’s important to have a strategy that will give you a steady supply of at least minimal power. Switch to rechargeable batteries, and get a solar battery charger so that you can keep a renewable power source in your possession at all times. Consider the various other options, such as propane gas, wind power and solid solar panels with marine batteries and inverters.\r\n	2014-07-17 14:14:34.445106	2014-07-17 14:14:34.445106
18	5	7	You don’t have to be an industrial engineer or an extremely wealthy person to put these together; just some motivation and perhaps a little elbow grease, and you’ll be on your way.\r\n\r\nThis volume is meant to help you begin your journey to medical preparedness. You won’t be a physician after reading this. I promise you, however, that you will know more about assuring your family’s medical well-being and be more of an asset than a liability to those you care about.\r\n\r\nIf you begin to prepare for difficult times, and maintain a positive attitude, you will be an example for others in your family or community to emulate. If they see that preparing just makes good old common sense, they might start to prepare as well. Imagine an entire community, nation or even the world ready to deal with life’s untoward events. In that circumstance, “conforming to the group” would actually be “sane”, and we would live in a truly “normal” world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Perception of Preparedness (L) vs. Actual Preparedness (R)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of reasons that the majority of the population chooses not to prepare for hard times. One reason relates to the perception that those that store food and other items are full of “Doom and Gloom”. Many in the general public still see the old-time camouflage-clad survivalists when they think of preparedness. Certainly, their portrayal in the media has done little to rehabilitate this image.\r\n\r\nThe term “Doom and Gloom” itself is full of the worst connotations; synonymous with despair and inaction, very few are willing to identify with what they consider to be a personality flaw. I don’t blame them. Placing oneself into a category that always sees the negative in a situation is an unattractive option.\r\n\r\nYet, events are occurring in rapid succession. Our quality of life is being eroded even as we speak. The downward spiral may be starting, and it’s difficult for many to escape a negative attitude when they consider the future of our society. The problems are many, and the solutions are few (and they are painful, as well).\r\n\r\nIt is easy to choose the despair and inaction that goes with being a “Doom and Gloomer”; there’s not a lot of sweat involved in sitting in front of a television or computer, bemoaning the ills of modern-day civilization. You don’t have to study or learn new skills; you don’t have to change your current lifestyle. You can just sit there and watch soap operas and reality shows. Although there’s not a lot to like about the term “Doom and Gloom”, plenty of people are just fine with the apathetic, do-nothing attitude that goes along with it.\r\n\r\nThese are dangerous times. There are many (very many) who are in denial of this fact. These people could be cured of this denial simply by examining current events. “Storms of the Century” are occurring with regularity, and our infrastructure and reserves suffer as a result. Even many in the path of a disaster shake it off without a second thought, despite the loss of lives and property.\r\n\r\nBesides those in denial, we return to the “Doom and Gloomers”, fully aware of the situation but apathetically waiting for the apocalypse in a morose stupor. They will be no better off than the oblivious majority in times of trouble; worse, really, as they have been miserable for a longer time.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, their negativity has soured the general public on the idea of preparedness. For the future of our society, this is probably the worst legacy of the “Doom and Gloom” mindset. The less prepared our citizens are for hard times, the more difficult it will be for there to be a future at all.\r\n\r\nThere is hope, however. The preparedness community understands that there can be rough seas ahead. They see the signs of the deterioration that have begun to erode the civilization that we have enjoyed for so long. Facts do not cease to exist just because they are ignored, and we may be on the brink of a meltdown.\r\n\r\nSo, why do today’s Preppers have an advantage over everyone else in terms of their potential for success in the future? Because, unlike the “Doom and Gloom” crowd, they have evolved a new, more positive philosophy which we will call: “Doom and BLOOM”.\r\n\r\nAdherents of the “Doom and Bloom” philosophy view negative current events with an unblinking eye. There is neither denial nor sugarcoating of the factors that might send things south, perhaps in a hurry. This is, if you will, the “Doom” part. Instead of despair and inaction, however, the preparedness community has hope and determination. They see the danger, but also a very special opportunity: The opportunity to become truly self-reliant. This is the “Bloom” part. They see the challenges of today as a wake-up call. It might be an alarm, but it’s also a call to action.\r\n\r\nUnlike others, the Self-Reliant Nation is positive that there are ways to succeed in the coming hard times. They look to what has worked before there was high technology. They see how their grandparents and great-grandparents succeeded, and they are learning skills that their ancestors had; skills that modern society has lost somewhere along the way.\r\n\r\n“Doom and BLOOMERS” see the silver lining in those storm clouds, and are learning how to grow their own food, take care of their own health, and provide for their common defense. There’s a learning curve, to be sure, but every bit of knowledge that they can absorb will mean a better future for themselves and their loved ones. They are applying lessons from the past to assure themselves that future.\r\n\r\nIf the public’s perception of the preparedness community is one of “Doom and Bloom” rather than “Doom and Gloom”, the association would be one with positivity and “can-do”, instead of negativity and inertia. This would allow those who have prepared for tough times to serve as ambassadors of hope. With the acceptance of a positive viewpoint, a rebirth of a collapsed civilization would not only be possible, but would be inevitable. Armed with knowledge and skills to function in a power-down situation, “Doom and Bloomers” would be the vanguard for the establishment of a self-sustainable society.\r\n\r\nIt is not just wishful thinking. It may be seem daunting to you, but it is well within your potential. It has been said that a 1000 mile journey begins with the first step. Take that first step today, and you’ll be ahead of the crowd in terms of assuring your survival and that of your loved ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA good percentage of the population has an uneasy feeling about the future. They have heard all the dire predictions of the last 50 years: The Soviet union   and the U.S. will destroy the world in a nuclear war. Y2K will make the entire power grid shut down.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, every year, there is a Doomsday prediction, and, every year, it fails to come to fruition (whew!). Mayan Apocalypses have come and gone. A new series of predictions, even more dire, for the coming years are also out there. Yet, because we have cried “Wolf” so many times without an actual collapse event happening, the general public has become jaded. Apathy mixed with inertia is their response. This is a dangerous attitude, as the wolf really may show up, eventually, and we are totally unprepared for him.\r\n\r\nHave we reached the high water mark as a civilization? There are some signs that we have. One sure sign of the decline of a civilization is the inability to reproduce the technological achievements of its past. Although we are still moving forward technologically in many areas, this sign is now visible. For example, we no longer have the capability or desire to put a man on the moon. The end of the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs now confines the human race to our own planet. This is not the best course of action for a planet with limited resources and a burgeoning population. Resources that were once earmarked for space travel, however, now are needed simply to keep people fed and the infrastructure in place. This sad state of economic affairs affects many nations that are experiencing difficulties just keeping their heads above water.	2014-07-17 14:14:52.018193	2014-07-17 14:14:52.018193
5	2	1	Bright sunlight filled the room as she drew open the heavy door of the lord’s chamber and tore past the enormous wooden bed, the half-unpacked trunks carrying her belongings, and the small table that held a pitcher and basin for washing. Heart now in her throat, she knelt on the bench under the window, leaned on the thick stone sill, and peered through the fine glazed window to the courtyard below.\r\n\r\nShe knew it was wrong, and her brother would be furious to discover her fascination with the rebel prisoner, but she couldn’t help it. There was something about him that stood out. And it wasn’t just his formidable size or his handsome face, although she had to admit that was what had attracted her initially. Nay, he was…kind. And noble. Even if he was a rebel. How many times had she watched him take the blame (and thus the punishment) for one of the weaker men? Or shoulder more than his share of the burden of the work?\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t be…\r\n\r\nMEDICAL!!!\r\n\r\nShe refused to finish the thought and scanned the cobble courtyard and wall area between the southeast tower and newly constructed gatehouse where the prisoners were working.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd of men near the wall there were no more than a handful of the rebels, but they were being guarded by at least a score of her brother’s men. Given the state of the prisoners, it seemed an overabundance of caution. Perhaps when the castle was first taken over a month ago such a show of force might have been warranted, but stripped of their crude leather warcoats and weapons, after weeks of imprisonment with barely enough food and water to keep them alive, and being worked nearly to death all day, the raggedy-looking prisoners appeared ill equipped to mount much of a resistance.\r\n\r\nExcept for one.\r\n\r\nShe looked and looked, the panic rising in her chest. Where was he? Had he been one of the men crushed?\r\n\r\nHot tears prickled her eyes, and she told herself she was being ridiculous. He was a prisoner. A Scot. One of Robert the Bruce’s rebels.\r\n\r\nBut he was also…\r\n\r\nMEDICAL!!!\r\nHer heart slammed, and she let out a small cry of relief, when the powerfully built warrior stepped out from behind the wall.\r\n\r\nThank God! He was all right. More than all right, actually—he was spectacular.\r\n\r\nShe sighed with every bit of her almost-seventeen-year-old heart. The women at court teased her mercilessly about her naivety and innocence. “You’re such a child, Rosie-lin,” they’d say with a roll of the eyes when she dared to venture into their conversations (the nickname sounded much nicer coming from her brother than from them).\r\n\r\nWell, she certainly wasn’t feeling like a child now. For the first time in her life, she was feeling like a woman utterly entranced by a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL!!!\r\nAnd what a man! He was the fodder of legend and bard’s tales. Tall and broad-shouldered, his dark hair hanging in long tangled waves around a brutishly handsome face, he was one of the strongest, most imposing-looking warriors she’d ever seen.\r\n\r\nAs if to prove her point, he bent down to pick up an enormous stone. Her breath caught and her heart started to flutter wildly in her chest. Despite the coolness in the room, her skin warmed with a flush. The damp linen shirt stretched across his broad chest with the effort, revealing every ridge, every bulge, every sharply defined muscle straining underneath—of which there were an abundance. Even weakened by imprisonment, he looked strong enough to tear apart a garrison of soldiers with his bare hands.\r\n\r\nShe revised her earlier opinion: Perhaps the large number of soldiers keeping watch was prudent after all.\r\n\r\nOnly when he disappeared around the other side of the wall did she remember to breathe again. A few minutes later, he reappeared and it would start all over again. Every now and then, he would exchange a word or two with one of the prisoners, before one of the guards broke it up—usually with the flick of a switch.\r\n\r\nHe spoke most often to a tall, blond-haired man, though he wasn’t as friendly to him as he was with the third red-haired man. He was also tall, but that was where the similarities ended. More than any of the other prisoners, the red-haired man was showing the effects of the hard labor. He was gaunt and pale, and every day he seemed to grow more stooped.\r\n\r\nThe Scot—that is how she thought of the impressive warrior—did what he could to help him when the guards were not looking, by shouldering some of his rocks or taking his place in line to wield the hammer. She’d even seen the Scot pass the other man the precious few ladles of water they were allowed during their brief breaks. But the man was fading before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the window. She had to stop. She couldn’t do this. It made her feel so helpless. She knew they were rebels and deserved to be punished, but the man was going to die. That he would probably be executed anyway when the work was done didn’t matter. No one should suffer like that.\r\n\r\nShe picked up her needlework, but she put it down a few minutes later and returned her gaze to the window.\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t look away. She had to do something. But what? Her brother had warned her not to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe answer came to her the next morning after church. As she was leaving morning prayers, she caught sight of a serving woman carrying a large bowl and a few pieces of bread toward the prison—a paltry amount for so many men.\r\n\r\nThat was it! She would leave them extra food.\r\n\r\nIt took her a few days to come up with a plan, but eventually she was ready to put it in motion.\r\n\r\nSneaking extra bits of beef was the easy part. She wrapped them in the cloth she kept at her lap while she ate, and then tucked the bundle in the purse at her waist before she left. Getting the food to the prisoners, however, was the challenge.\r\n\r\nShe’d watched the prisoners enough to know their routine. Every morning the guards led them out through the small courtyard between the chapel and the damaged Great Hall to the main courtyard. They were lined up and given instructions before being permitted to collect the carts, which were stored on the side of the bakehouse. The carts were what she was aiming for.\r\n\r\nThat night, when the castle was quiet, she donned a dark cloak and snuck out of the tower. Keeping to the shadows, she worked her way around the yard, careful to avoid any guards who might be on patrol. But it was remarkably quiet. With the rebel forces crushed, there was little threat of an attack. She quickly deposited her bundle in one of the carts and made her way back up to her chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning she watched from her window as one of the men returned with the cart, immediately went to the Scot, and surreptitiously passed him the bundle. The Scot looked around, as if suspecting a trick, but when one of the guards barked an order at him—presumably to get to work—she saw the faint twist of a smile.\r\n\r\nThat smile was all the encouragement she needed. Her nighttime excursions continued for a week, and she swore the dark red-haired man grew stronger. Many of the men seemed to walk a little taller.\r\n\r\nShe knew her brother would be furious if he discovered what she was doing—and she hated the idea of a secret between them—but she told herself it was but a small gesture and could do no harm.\r\n\r\nBut she was wrong. Terribly wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosalin yawned as one of the attendants who’d accompanied her from London finished twisting her long plaits under the veil and circlet “You look tired, m’lady,” the older woman said, a concerned look in her eye. “Are you not feeling well?”\r\n\r\nAfter eight nights the loss of sleep was catching up with her, but Rosalin managed a smile. “Well enough, Lenore. Nothing a few extra hours of sleep won’t cure. I fear I’ve been staying up with my brother and the earl—”	2014-07-17 13:51:14.188358	2014-07-18 09:20:21.344527
